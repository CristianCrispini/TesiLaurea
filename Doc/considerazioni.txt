Xydeas  and  Petrovic:
proposed an information measure for image fusion performance. In their
paper the visual information was associated with the ‘edge’ information.
In that case, only the edge information was of concern, while the region
information was ignored.

For applications in
which images are ultimately to be viewed by human be-
ings, the only “correct” method of quantifying visual im-
age quality is through subjective evaluation.
In practice, however, subjective evaluation is usually too inconvenient,
time-consuming and expensive.

MSE, which objectively quantifies
the strength of the error signal. But two distorted images
with the same MSE may have very different types of errors,
some of which are much more visible than others. 

he image quality assessment isnot specially designed to assess the performance of medical imagefusion methods.
For example, structural similarity (SSIM), root-mean-square error (RMSE),
MI and SF are used as image qualityassessment tools in both medical image fusion and the other im-age processing algorithms.
SSIM metric is used as tools in evalu-ating the quality of images in video[46–49]
and image compres-sion[50].MIandSFmetrics are used as tools in assessing the quality of images in multi-focus image fusion[51,52]
and multi-sensor image fusion[53]. Moreover,RMSEmetric is used as tools inpredicting the quality of images in image denoising[54].

One problem with traditional mutual information metric [28] is that it is unstable
and may bias the measure towards the source image
with the highest entropy.
