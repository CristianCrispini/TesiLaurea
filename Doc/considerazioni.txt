Image fusion performance measures (MI)-------------------------------------------------------------------------
depend mainly on estimating the amount of information transferred
from both source images into the resulting fused image.
valuation of fusion performance: One goal of image fusion is to
integrate complementary information from multiple sources so that

the new images are more suitable for the purpose of human visual 

perception and computer processing. Therefore, a measure should

estimate how much information is obtained from the input images.
In this Letter, mutual information is employed as a means of
assessing image fusion performance. It is well known that MI is a

basic concept of information theory measuring the statistical depen-

dence between two random variables and the amount of information

that one variable contains about the others. The measure presented here

states that the MI describes the similarity of the image intensity

distributions of the corresponding image pair. Let A and B be two
random variables with marginal probability distributions pA(a) and
pB(b), and joint probability distribution pAB(a, b). MI measures the
degree of dependence of the two random variables A and B.

For applications in
which images are ultimately to be viewed by human be-
ings, the only “correct” method of quantifying visual im-
age quality is through subjective evaluation.
In practice, however, subjective evaluation is usually too inconvenient,
time-consuming and expensive.

MSE, which objectively quantifies
the strength of the error signal. But two distorted images
with the same MSE may have very different types of errors,
some of which are much more visible than others. 

he image quality assessment isnot specially designed to assess the performance of medical imagefusion methods.
For example, structural similarity (SSIM), root-mean-square error (RMSE),
MI and SF are used as image qualityassessment tools in both medical image fusion and the other im-age processing algorithms.
SSIM metric is used as tools in evalu-ating the quality of images in video[46–49]
and image compres-sion[50].MIandSFmetrics are used as tools in assessing the quality of images in multi-focus image fusion[51,52]
and multi-sensor image fusion[53]. Moreover,RMSEmetric is used as tools inpredicting the quality of images in image denoising[54].

One problem with traditional mutual information metric [28] is that it is unstable
and may bias the measure towards the source image
with the highest entropy.
